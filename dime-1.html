<p class='text'>When you go to the bank and get a debt, you will have to pay interest on the amount that you got.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS INTEREST?</p>
<p class='text'>Interest is when you have to pay back some extra borrowed money to the person who gives it to you.</p>
<p class='text'>Benny goes to the store and sees a teddy bear he wants to buy. The teddy bear costs $10. He only brought $7. He can get a loan from his mom for $3. He will have to pay back the $3 that he owes to the mom and a little more because of interest ($4).</p>
<p class='text'>Interest will grow over time slowly. The longer you don‚Äôt pay back your loans, the more money you need to pay back later.

<p class='text'>When you go to the bank and get debt, you will have to pay interest on the amount that you got.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS INTEREST?</p>
<p class='text'>Benny wants to buy a phone The phone costs $50, but he only has $40. He can get a loan from the bank for $10. He will have to pay back the $10 that he owes to his mom and a little more because of interest. In the end, he will pay a total of $57.50 because of interest.</p>
<p class='text'>Interest on your debts are bad, but having interests on your savings account is good. The interest that the banks add on your savings is called ‚Äúcompound interest.‚Äù</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS COMPOUND INTEREST?</p>
<p class='text'>Compound interest is when interest builds up. For instance, when you put $1000 into the bank, the bank usually has an interest rate of 0.06%, so in the first month you would make $0.60. In your bank account, you would have $1000.60. In the second month, instead of adding another $0.60, you would add $0.66. This is because you are taking 0.06% of $1000.60 instead of $1000. Over time it can build up very fast to high prices that can build up to be far beyond the actual purchase price.

<p class='text'>When you take in debt from a loan, credit card, or mortgage, you have to pay a fee called interest.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS INTEREST?</p>
<p class='text'>Interest is when you have to pay back extra money on top of what you owe because of the time spent to pay back the amount.  In other words, the longer it takes you to pay back your debt, the more interest you need to pay. In the long run, it can build up to a lot of money and make it difficult to get out of debt.</p>
<p class='text'>Interest will grow slowly over time. The longer you don‚Äôt pay back your loans, the more money you need to pay back later. This is a reason that many people are broke: they take debts and are so overwhelmed by the interest as it builds up that they can‚Äôt get out. However, not all interest is bad. There is a thing called ‚Äúcompound interest‚Äù that you can use to your advantage.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS COMPOUND INTEREST?</p>
<p class='text'>It is interest on top of interest. For instance, when you put $1000 into the bank, the bank usually has an interest rate of 0.06%, so in the first month you would make $0.60. In your bank account, you would have $1000.60. In the second month, instead of adding another $0.60, you would add $0.66. This is because you are taking 0.06% of $1000.60 instead of $1000. This kind of exponential interest is called compound interest.</p>
<p class='text'>Credit card companies take advantage of interest so that their companies are able to profit significantly more than expected. 60% of the monthly credit card payment is profit for the credit card company. That means that the amount you spend is only around 40% of what you need to pay back.</p>
<p class='text'>The rule of 72 is a simple way to calculate how many years it will take to double your money in a bank account. The equation is: 72 / interest rate = years to double money. For example, an interest rate of 2% would take 36 years to double your money, whereas a rate of 4% would take 18 years to double your money. Interest in a bank account takes an extremely long time to truly be noticeable and worthwhile, thus not being as effective as other ways to make money. </p>
