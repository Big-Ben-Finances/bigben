    <h1 class="text">What it is</h1>
    <p class="text">We made Big Ben to prepare the future generations for the tough financial environment America has. Currently, 32% of Americans are registered as bankrupt and only 5% of American are millionaires! In other words, only 5% of Americans have achieved financial peace. Habits such as spending and debt put most Americans into bankruptcy and massive amounts of debt that takes years to pay off. The purpose of BigBen is to help our future generation develop good habits early on so that they know how to avoid developing bad habits later.</p>
    <h1 class="text">Why</h1>
    <p class="text">Looking at our competitors, we noticed that despite the fact that it was designed for kids, it didn’t really have a kid-friendly interface. All of us being kids, we knew the things that we enjoyed seeing in a website, such as bright and exciting colors, lots of different photos, fun examples, cool fonts, and challenges. Unfortunately, in most currently existing financial platforms for kids, little to none of these expectations are met, which makes the experience an overall disgusting one. We fear that this experience will lead our next generation to have a negative view on the world of finances, thinking:

“It’s really boring and excessive!”
“Nothing about it is interesting at all!”
“Why can’t I just do something else?”

By creating our website, we wanted to reverse these views by providing young children with a positive look on finances at a young age, which will carry on a good impression of it as they mature into adults. </p>
