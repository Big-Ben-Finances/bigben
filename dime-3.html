<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS THE ECONOMY?</p>
<p class='text'>The economy is a system of buying and selling with a type of currency. A small store to the biggest Walmart is all part of the economy. Any country’s power is based on how strong their economy is. The thing is, the economy's currencies can weaken and strengthen with something called inflation.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS INFLATION?</p>
<p class='text'>Inflation is when a currency is losing value. This can happen when the country prints too much of that currency, causing people to have tons of it. That or when a massive event occurs, weakening the economy. This can cause whole economies to change.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>HOW CAN INFLATION AFFECT ECONOMIES?</p>
<p class='text'>Economies can change for the worse with inflation. For example, when Germany printed a lot of german marks to pay off a deal in a treaty after World War II, a single dollar was worth trillions of german marks. This caused rich families with a lot of german marks to suddenly turn poor because each german mark they were earning was shrinking to a tiny value. This means that the families can’t buy as many luxuries, or even necessities, which causes companies to not be able to make money, which causes unemployment.</p>
<p class='text'>This can also be good for the economy in the short run. During World War 1, America was booming. It was called the “Roaring Twenties”. A bunch of new companies were created because a lot of inventions were being created, like the television, radios, and a lot more. Because of all of these cool companies, people wanted to buy stocks in those companies, even if they didn’t know the health of the company. This made the stock market boom for a while. This era lasted for a while, but came to a halting stop when General Motors started to lose some money. Since people were so scared to lose money, they sold right away, which caused a huge loss in stocks. That means the stock market will crash. This caused the stock market to nose dive.

<p class='text'>What is money? What determines it’s value and how is it tracked around the world? These questions are the foundation of a study called economics.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT ARE ECONOMICS?</p>
<p class='text'>Economics is the study of the average wealth of each individual, taking into account businesses and the flow of money between groups. It takes into account all aspects of the currency.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS THE ECONOMY?</p>
<p class='text'>The economy is the system of trade made by humans. The economy is about money and the value of it. The value of money shifts in different events, causing the economy to shift. The value of money can shake whole economies and devalue fortunes.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>WHAT IS THIS SHIFT IN THE VALUE OF MONEY?</p>
<p class='text'>The shift in the value of money is the product of basic economics. It is governed by the fundamental law of supply and demand. When the supply of the money goes up (meaning the government printed more money) the value goes down. This balance of the amount of money is what runs and destroys economies. An increase in the amount of money devalues the money, this is called inflation. A decrease in the amount of money increases the value of the money, this is called deflation.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>HOW DOES INFLATION AFFECT THE ECONOMY?</p>
<p class='text'>Inflation can severely damage the health of an economy. Inflation leads to the value of products rising, meaning less customers can afford the products. With less customers that can afford the product, companies start dying which kills jobs. The loss of jobs means that less people can afford products and the cycle continues, snowballing the economy into oblivion. A good example of inflation going wrong is the devaluation of the German reichsmark (because of the german Nazi reich). After World War 2, Germany had to pay the Allies a fee for their war crimes. Germany could barely afford to pay the fee, so they printed more reichsmarks. This led to the devaluation of the reichsmark and soon the United States dollar was worth 1 trillion times more than a reichsmark. The sudden worthlessness of a reichsmark left rich families poor, as their fortunes were worth nothing now that the value of their currency tumbled. No companies can survive and employers laid off employees, leading to smaller sales. This snowballed for years until Germany created a new currency, the deutsche mark. This shows the dangers of inflation.</p>
<p class='text' style='font-size:20px;'>HOW DOES DEFLATION AFFECT THE ECONOMY?</p>
<p class='text'>Deflation can both be good and bad for the economy. First of all it helps the economy by lowering prices so more people buy things. This means that companies have more money to invest in new products and more people buy things. Overall this means that the economy grows more healthy and sustainable. The bad side of deflation is that consumers expect lower prices so they don’t pay until they get lower prices. This is bad for companies because it kills their profit margin so they’re forced to lay off employees. This means less people can afford to buy things so companies lay off more employees. This snowballs until it becomes a recession or depression.</p>
